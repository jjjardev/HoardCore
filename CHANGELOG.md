## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- Single-file ingestion engine (`hoardcore.py`): scrape, crawl, search, discover,
  and the agentic `research` action (`DISCOVER -> INGEST -> RECALL -> EMIT`).
- Persistent SQLite vault (FTS5 + lexical vectors) with hybrid RRF retrieval and
  safe empty/punctuation-only query handling.
- Key-free web discovery (DuckDuckGo HTML with Mojeek fallback) through the
  resilient fetch chain (aiohttp -> curl_cffi -> optional FlareSolverr).
- Semantic chunking, junk-filtering, and DB-hygiene context manager
  (commit / rollback / close).
- Provenance-tagged artifacts (`[V]`/`[E]`/`[H]`) with path-traversal-safe
  `write_artifact()`.
- Agent integration: `AGENTS.md` trigger + `skill.md` operating manual,
  tested against the OpenCode harness.
- License: MIT.

### Quality
- pytest suite (21 tests): vault, network/fetch chain, junk detection.
- CI via GitHub Actions (lint with `ruff`, tests on Python 3.11 & 3.12).
